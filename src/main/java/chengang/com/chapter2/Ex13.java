/*
Download the JAR file for OpenCSV from http://opencsv.sourceforge.net. Write a class with a main method that reads a CSV
file of your choice and prints some of the content. There is sample code on the OpenCSV web site. You havenâ€™t yet
learned to deal with exceptions. Just use the following header for the main method:

public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception

The point of this exercise is not to do anything useful with CSV files, but to practice using a library that is
delivered as a JAR file.
